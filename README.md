# Regulator RNN
Reimplementation of __"Finding gene network topologies for given
biological function with recurrent neural network"__ ([Shen et al. 2020](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-021-23420-5)) for educational purposes[^1].

Main changes are in modularity, using torch instead of tensorflow, adding default plotting functionality, and building a pypi package for easy distribution.

Installation:
```
pip install regulatory_rnn
```

Usage examples can be found in the notebooks folder.
